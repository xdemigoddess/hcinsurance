# Welcome to the Healthcare Insurance Data Exploration & Linear Regression Model Project
Here, I set out to explore the health insurance dataset, courtesy of Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, as well as apply multiple linear regression models to the dataset. The aim of this project is to note any significant patterns in the variables of this dataset to predict charge values. In this repository, you will find the R markdown file as well as its pdf output following it.
